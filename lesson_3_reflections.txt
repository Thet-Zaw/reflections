When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want to work on my project with my friends away and set the project file public for suggestions.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because there will be incomplete and unnecessary changes in the remote repository that I don't want to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are used when we want to copy repositories from one's Github account to another's Github account.
	Clones are used when we want to copy repositories from Github from local or local to local.
	Branches are used when we want to make another version in a repository.
