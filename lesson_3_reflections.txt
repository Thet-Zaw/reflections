When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want to work on my project with my friends away and set the project file public for suggestions.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because there will be incomplete and unnecessary changes in the remote repository that I don't want to pull.
